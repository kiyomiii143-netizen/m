      "We were classmates in one subject in college, even though we were in different programs. We weren’t even supposed to meet — but we still did. From that one class came late-night chats, small favors, shared jokes, and eventually the kind of comfort that already felt like home.",
      "On January 2, 2022, Paula pranked Nathaniel and told him that her mom didn’t like him and that they shouldn’t be together. The next day she couldn’t take it anymore, confessed it was all a joke… and finally said yes to him.",
      "On April 14, 2025, Nathaniel asked her to marry him. Paula said yes (after happy crying). Now here we are — excited, grateful, and finally inviting you."
